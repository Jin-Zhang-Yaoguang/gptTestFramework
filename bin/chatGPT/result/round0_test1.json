    "Q2.If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?": "To find the time it would take 100 machines to make 100 widgets, we can divide the number of minutes it would take for 5 machines to make 5 widgets by the number of machines to make 100 widgets.5 machines * 5 minutes/machine = 25 minutesSo it would take 100 machines 25 minutes to make 100 widgets.",
    "Q3.In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?": "To find the time it would take for the patch to cover half of the lake, we can set up an equation:2 * 48 = 96So it would take 96 / 2 = 48 days for the patch to cover half of the lake."
