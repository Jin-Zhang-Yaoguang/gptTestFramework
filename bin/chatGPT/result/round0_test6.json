    "For each task I will give you a scenario that you might encounter in the role for which you are interviewing, then four responses were given and you should give me the best response and the worst response.1.Scenario:You manage a large retail department store. Your staff comprise various-sized sales/service teams; each of which manages a department's customer orders. You've been concerned about the increasing signs of poor team morale amongst the largest three teams.Response:You summon the three team leaders separately to hear their ideas and explanations.Leave things to settle down a little bit longer, rather than causing anyone distress.Approach some staff from each of the three teams for an informal chat.Hold a brainstorm meeting for all team leaders to get some fresh ideas.": "Best Response: You summon the three team leaders separately to hear their ideas and explanations. This shows that you are taking their concerns seriously and that you are willing to listen to their perspectives. You allow them to present their ideas and discuss them with each team, which allows them to feel valued and heard. This approach will also give you a better understanding of the root causes of the problem and allow you to come up with a more effective solution.Worst Response: You bring all three team leaders to your office to lecture them about their poor performance and to tell them what they need to do to improve. This approach will likely make the team members feel embarrassed and humiliated, and it may also demotivate them from making any changes. It will also make them less likely to trust you in the future.",

Each one of your team was told to work together and to complete all tasks by the end of the week. Unfortunately, it's now clear to you that none of the team objectives have been achieved. In fact your individually assigned objectives only had mixed success as well.Response:Use 1-on-1's to discuss effective targets and to jointly agreeing new ones.Scrap the objective setting idea since it clearly doesn’t work.Mail the team an urgent request to work more closely together.Organise a team meeting to discuss attitudes and lack of effort being shown.": "Best Response: Use 1-on-1's to discuss effective targets and to jointly agreeing new ones. This approach shows that you are proactive and willing to work with your team to find a solution. It also allows you to get to know each team member individually and to understand their strengths and weaknesses. By working together, you can come up with more specific and achievable goals for each team member.Worst Response: Scrap the objective setting idea since it clearly doesn’t work. This approach can be seen as dismissive and unempathetic towards the team's efforts. It may also make the team members feel that their ideas and opinions are not valued. It would be better to take a step back and think about why the previous approach didn't work and come up with a new strategy that takes into account the team's feedback and suggestions. Mailing the team an urgent request to work more closely together may also come across as an attack and can be demotivating. An organised team meeting may not be the best approach as it can be seen as confrontational and can make the team members defensive.",

This approach is direct and to the point. It tells the new nurse that their behavior is not acceptable and that it is important to listen to others. It also sends a message that the team values everyone's contributions and that it is not acceptable to monopolize the conversation.Worst Response: Ask why your more experienced team members are not offering their own solutions. This approach can be seen as accusatory and can put the team members on the defensive. It may also make the new nurse feel singled out and misunderstood. Firmly suggesting to your new colleague that it's fairer to let everyone contribute may come across as bossy and disrespectful. Assuming the others agree with you may make the team members feel that their opinions and expertise are not valued. It is important to give the team members a chance to speak and to find a solution that works for everyone.",

This approach is direct and to the point. It immediately addresses the issue of low job satisfaction and poor team spirit by bringing the team together to discuss the problem. It also sets a clear objective for the meeting which is to highlight the objectives and the lack of collaboration.Worst Response: Start by introducing half-hour, weekly catch-up meetings for the while team. This approach can be seen as too directive and may come across as bossy. It may also not take into account the team's preferences and it may not be effective if the team is not used to working in a collaborative way. Implement compulsory training courses on interpersonal skills as soon as possible. This approach may not be well received by the team as it may be seen as an unnecessary intrusion. It is important to be respectful and to understand the team's needs before implementing any new strategy. Email regular updates on each one's progress may not be the most effective way to communicate with the team as it may not allow them to express their thoughts and concerns. It is better to have a regular 1-1's meeting to discuss the team's progress and to give the team members a chance to voice their concerns and to be heard.",

This approach is indirect and to the point. It takes the responsibility away from the intern and puts it on the individual to learn from their mistakes. It also sends a message that the company values quality and that the intern should be aware of the consequences of their work.Worst Response: Forward the draft report to other analysts in your department for their own comments. This approach can be seen as a lack of support and can make the intern feel isolated and unsupported. It may also create a blame game and can make the team members defensive. Ask your own manager what would have happened if you hadn't checked this report. This approach can be seen as a lack of trust in the intern and can make the intern feel undervalued. Email your collated amends to the intern; offering to explain each one in further detail. This approach may not give the intern the opportunity to learn from their mistakes and may not allow them to improve their work.

It also sends a message that the team's time is valuable and that the team leader has important work to attend to.Worst Response: Gently wrap up the session, then hold a presentation review later that day. This approach can be seen as indecisive and can make the team members feel uncertain. It may also not address the issue of the presentation being too long and it may not allow the team members to fully understand the situation.
